# NewtonMethod
Testing Newton's method (root-finding algorithm) in Python

**Language: Python**

**Start: 2012**

## Why
[Newton's method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_method) allows you to find the roots (zeros) of a function in an area defined by a point (x0). I had probably studied this back in school. Anyhow, I stumbled into it years later and decided to implement it in Python to test it out.

## Example
Example with function:

```
y = 5 * x^2 - 10 * x - 7
```
