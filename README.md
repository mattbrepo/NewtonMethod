# NewtonMethod
Testing Newton's method (root-finding algorithm) in Python.

**Language: Python**

**Start: 2012**

## Why
The [Newton's method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_method) allows finding the roots (zeros) of a function. I had probably studied this back in school. Anyhow, I stumbled into it years later and decided to implement it in Python to test it out.

## Example
Example with the following function:

$$ y = 5 x^2 - 10 x - 7 $$

![Results](/images/console2.png)

$$ x = -0.5491933384829668, y = 0 $$

$$ x = 2.5491933384829664, y = 0 $$
